	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent Neglected Tropical Disease, affecting approximately 250 million people worldwide. Schistosoma mansoni is the most important species causing human intestinal schistosomiasis. Despite significant efforts in recent decades, the global disease burden of schistosomiasis remains extremely high. This could partly be attributed to the absence of accurate diagnostic tools, primarily in endemic areas. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is increasingly used in molecular diagnostics as a field-friendly alternative to many other complex molecular methods and it has been proposed as an ideal candidate for revolutionizing point-of-care molecular diagnostics. In a previous work, a LAMP-based method to detect S. mansoni DNA (SmMIT-LAMP) was developed by our research group for early diagnosis of active schistosomiasis in an experimental infection murine model. The SmMIT-LAMP has been further successfully evaluated in both human stool and snail samples and, recently, in human urine samples. In this study, we developed an important improvement for SmMIT-LAMP molecular assay, transforming it into a cold maintenance dry format suitable for potentially manufacturing as kit for ready-to-use for schistosomiasis diagnosis. This procedure could be applied to create dry LAMP kits for a laboratory setting and for diagnostic applications for other neglected tropical diseases.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid and sensitive tool used for the diagnosis of a variety of infectious diseases. One of the advantages of this method over the polymerase chain reaction is that DNA amplification occurs at a constant temperature, usually between 60–65°C; therefore, expensive devices are unnecessary for this step. However, LAMP still requires complicated sample preparation steps and a well-equipped laboratory to produce reliable and reproducible results, which limits its use in resource-poor laboratories in most developing countries. In this study, we made several substantial modifications to the technique to carry out on-site diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in remote areas using LAMP. The first essential improvement was that LAMP reagents were dried and stabilized in a single tube by incorporating trehalose as a cryoprotectant to prolong shelf life at ambient temperature. The second technical improvement was achieved by simplifying the sample preparation step so that DNA or RNA could be amplified directly from detergent-lysed blood samples. With these modifications, diagnosis of HAT in local clinics or villages in endemic areas becomes a reality, which could greatly impact on the application of diagnosis not only for HAT but also for other tropical diseases.},

Here we describe Corona Detective, a sensitive and rapid molecular test to detect the virus, based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which could be applied anywhere at low cost. Critically, the method uses freeze-dried reagents, readily shipped without cold-chain dependence. The reaction detects the viral nucleocapsid gene through a sequence-specific quenched-fluorescence readout, which avoids false positives and also allows multiplex detection with an internal control cellular RNA. Corona Detective can be used in 8-tube strips to be read with a simple open-design fluorescence detector. Other methods to use and produce Corona Detective locally in a variety of formats are possible and already openly shared. Detection specificity is ensured through inclusion of positive and negative control reactions to run in parallel with the diagnostic reactions. A simple user protocol, including sample preparation, and a bioinformatics pipeline to ensure that viral variants will still be detectable with SARS-CoV-2 primer sets complete the method. Through rapid production and distribution of Corona Detective reactions, quite inexpensive at scale, daily or weekly surveillance testing of large populations, without waiting for symptoms to develop, is anticipated, in combination with vaccination campaigns, to finally control this pandemic.},

The effects will continue to grow and worsen if economies begin to open without the proper precautions, including expanded diagnostic capabilities. To address this need for increased testing, we have developed a sensitive reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay compatible with current reagents, which utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 min. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was optimized to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. This simple inactivation and purification pipeline is inexpensive and compatible with other downstream RNA detection platforms and uses readily available reagents. It should increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.},

In this review, available types of LAMP techniques will be discussed together with their applications in detection of various micro-organisms. Up to date, there are varieties of LAMP detection methods available including colorimetric and fluorescent detection, real-time monitoring using turbidity metre and detection using lateral flow device which will also be highlighted in this review. Apart from that, commercialization of LAMP technique had also been reported such as lyophilized form of LAMP reagents kit and LAMP primer sets for detection of pathogenic micro-organisms.

	abstract = {Reverse-transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has frequently been proposed as an enabling technology for simplified diagnostic tests for RNA viruses. However, common detection techniques used for LAMP and RT-LAMP have drawbacks, including poor discrimination capability, inability to multiplex targets, high rates of false positives, and (in some cases) the requirement of opening reaction tubes postamplification. Here, we present a simple technique that allows closed-tube, target-specific detection, based on inclusion of a dye-labeled primer that is incorporated into a target-specific amplicon if the target is present. A short, complementary quencher hybridizes to unincorporated primer upon cooling down at the end of the reaction, thereby quenching fluorescence of any unincorporated primer. Our technique, which we term QUASR (for quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters, read “quasar”), does not significantly reduce the amplification efficiency or sensitivity of RT-LAMP. Equipped with a simple LED excitation source and a colored plastic gel filter, the naked eye or a camera can easily discriminate between positive and negative QUASR reactions, which produce a difference in signal of approximately 10:1 without background subtraction. We demonstrate that QUASR detection is compatible with complex sample matrices such as human blood, using a novel LAMP primer set for bacteriophage MS2 (a model RNA virus particle). Furthermore, we demonstrate single-tube duplex detection of West Nile virus (WNV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) RNA.},

DNA polymerases from prokaryotes can effectively synthesize long stretches of linear double-stranded DNA in the complete absence of added primer and template DNAs. Ab initio DNA synthesis is extremely enhanced if a restriction endonuclease or nicking endonuclease is added to the reaction with DNA polymerase. The synthesized ab initio DNA have various tandem repeats. Sequences similar to those of ab initio DNA products are found in many natural genes. The significance of ab initio DNA synthesis is that genetic information can be created directly by protein. The ab initio DNA synthesis is considered a non-specific synthesis in various DNA amplification techniques. In this review, we present the main studies devoted to this phenomenon and introduce possible mechanisms of this synthesis from our current knowledge.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid and reliable sequence-specific isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique. To date, all reported real-time detection methods for LAMP have been restricted to single targets, limiting the utility of this technique. Here, we adapted standard LAMP primers to contain a quencher-fluorophore duplex region that upon strand separation results in a gain of fluorescent signal. This approach permitted the real-time detection of 1–4 target sequences in a single LAMP reaction tube utilizing a standard real-time fluorimeter. The methodology was highly reproducible and sensitive, detecting below 100 copies of human genomic DNA. It was also robust, with a 7-order of magnitude dynamic range of detectable targets. Furthermore, using a new strand-displacing DNA polymerase or its warm-start version, Bst 2.0 or Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerases, resulted in 50\% faster amplification signals than wild-type Bst DNA polymerase, large fragment in this new multiplex LAMP procedure. The coupling of this new multiplex technique with next generation isothermal DNA polymerases should increase the utility of the LAMP method for molecular diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAT), such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification assays, especially for point-of-care and low resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.},

RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60–93\% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection.},

However, non-specific LAMP leading to false-positive outcomes has been observed frequently. To solve this problem, we selected six molecules as the additives for evaluating their effects on the improvement of the LAMP specificity. Experimental results show that bovine serum albumin (BSA) and DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) have negative effects on the LAMP specificity; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetramethylene sulfoxide (TMSO), and glycerol could inhibit the non-specific LAMP moderately. Surprisingly, pullulan shows an ability to inhibit the non-specific amplification of LAMP significantly without affecting the sample amplification of LAMP, and this inhibitory effect is concentration dependent. Thus, pullulan could be considered as the most promising additive to improve the amplification specificity in the LAMP-based detection and analysis of nucleic acids.},

Isothermal deoxyribonucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), exhibit characteristics ideal for point-of-care (POC) applications, since their instrumentation is simpler in comparison with the standard method of polymerase chain reaction. Other key advantages of LAMP are robustness and the production of pyrophosphate in the presence of the target gene, enabling to detect the reaction products using the naked eye. Polymerase inhibitors, presented in clinical samples, do not affect the amplification process, making LAMP suitable for a simple sample-to-answer diagnostic systems with simplified sample preparation. In this review, we discuss the trends in miniaturized LAMP techniques, such as microfluidic, paper-based, and digital with their advantages and disadvantages, especially for POC applications alongside our opinion of the future development of miniaturized LAMP.,

In a principle study, on-chip recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) on defined spots of a DNA microarray was used to spatially separate the amplification reaction of DNA from two viruses (Human adenovirus 41, Phi X 174) and the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which are relevant for water hygiene. By establishing the developed assay on the microarray analysis platform MCR 3, the automation of isothermal multiplex-amplification (39 °C, 40 min) and subsequent detection by chemiluminescence imaging was realized. Within 48 min, the microbes could be identified by the spot position on the microarray while the generated chemiluminescence signal correlated with the amount of applied microbe DNA. The limit of detection (LOD) determined for HAdV 41, Phi X 174, and E. faecalis was 35 GU/μL, 1 GU/μL, and 5 × 103 GU/μL (genomic units), which is comparable to the sensitivity reported for qPCR analysis, respectively. Moreover the simultaneous amplification and detection of DNA from all three microbes was possible. The presented assay shows that complex enzymatic reactions like an isothermal amplification can be performed in an easy-to-use experimental setup. Furthermore, iNAATs can be potent candidates for multipathogen detection in clinical, food, or environmental samples in routine or field monitoring approaches.},

Given the selective value of such repeats, it is likely that several different mechanisms have been responsible for their generation. One mechanism that has been shown to generate relatively long tandem repeats (in the kilobase range) is rolling circle replication. In this communication, we demonstrate that rolling circle synthesis in a simple enzymatic system can produce tandem repeats of monomers as short as 34 bp. In addition to suggesting possible origins for natural tandem repeats, these observations provide a facile means for constructing libraries of repeated motifs for use in "in vitro evolution" experiments designed to select molecules with defined biological or chemical properties.},

The ideal malaria diagnostic should be able to speciate; measure parasitemia; low-cost, quick, and simple to use; and capable of detecting low-level infections. A promising development are nucleic acid tests (NATs) for the diagnosis of malaria, which are well suited for point-of-care use because of their ability to detect low-level infections and speciate, and because they have high sensitivity and specificity. The greatest barrier to NAT use in the past has been its relatively high cost, and the amount of infrastructure required in the form of equipment, stable power, and reagent storage. This review describes recent developments to decrease the cost and run time, and increase the ease of use of NAT while maintaining their high sensitivity and specificity and low limit of detection at the point-of-care.},

	abstract = {Noroviruses are the most common agents causing outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis. Outbreaks originating from contaminated drinking water and from recreational waters have been described. Due to a lack of cell culture systems, noroviruses are detected mostly by molecular methods. Molecular detection assays for viruses in water are often repressed by inhibitory factors present in the environment, like humic acids and heavy metals. To study the effect of environmental inhibitors on the performance of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), we developed a real-time norovirus NASBA targeting part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Specificity of the assay was studied with 33 divergent clones that contained part of the targeted RdRp gene of noroviruses from 15 different genogroups. Viral RNA originated from commercial oysters, surface waters, and sewage treatment plants in The Netherlands. Ninety-seven percent of the clones derived from human noroviruses were detected by real-time NASBA. Two clones containing animal noroviruses were not detected by NASBA. We compared the norovirus detection by real-time NASBA with that by conventional reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) with large-volume river water samples and found that inhibitory factors of RT-PCR had little or no effect on the performance of the norovirus NASBA. This consequently resulted in a higher sensitivity of the NASBA assay than of the RT-PCR. We show that by combining an efficient RNA extraction method with real-time NASBA the sensitivity of norovirus detection in water samples increased at least 100 times, which consequently has implications for the outcome of the infectious risk assessment.},

	abstract = {On the ISS, as on Earth, water is an essential element for life and its quality control on a regular basis allows to ensure the health of the crew and the integrity of equipment. Currently, microbial water analysis onboard ISS still relies on the traditional culture-based microbiology methods. Molecular methods based on the amplification of nucleic acids for microbiological analysis of water quality show enormous potential and are considered as the best alternative to culture-based methods. For this reason, the Midass, a fully integrated and automated prototype was designed conjointly by ESA and bioMérieux for a rapid monitoring of the microbiological quality of air. The prototype allows air sampling, sample processing and the amplification/detection of nucleic acids. We describe herein the proof of principle of an analytical approach based on molecular biology that could fulfill the ESA's need for a rapid monitoring of the microbiological quality of recycled water onboard ISS. Both concentration and recovery of microorganisms are the main critical steps when the microfiltration technology is used for water analysis. Among filters recommended standards for monitoring the microbiological quality of the water, the polycarbonate filter was fully in line with the requirements of the ISO 7704-1985 standard in terms of efficacy of capture and recovery of bacteria. Moreover, this filter does not retain nucleic acids on the surface and has no inhibitory effect on their downstream processing steps such as purification and amplification/detection. Although the Midass system was designed for the treatment of air samples, the first results on the integration of PC filters were encouraging. Nevertheless, system modifications are needed to better adapt the Midass system for the monitoring of the microbiological water quality.},

	abstract = {We have developed a novel method, termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), that amplifies DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions. This method employs a DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target DNA initiates LAMP. The following strand displacement DNA synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded DNA. This serves as template for DNA synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem-loop DNA structure. In subsequent LAMP cycling one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement DNA synthesis, yielding the original stem-loop DNA and a new stem-loop DNA with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 10(9) copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem-loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because LAMP recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity.},

Key aspects of the combined RPA amplification/detection process are illustrated by a test for the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Versions of the reactions can proceed in either a linear or an exponential amplification mode. Both of these reactions require simple, constant conditions, and the rate of amplification depends entirely on the molecular parameters governing the interactions of the molecules in the reaction. The exponential version of the reaction is a molecular chain reaction that uses the oligonucleotide products of each linear reaction to create producers of more of the same oligonucleotide. It is a highly sensitive chain reaction that can be specifically triggered by given DNA sequences and can achieve amplifications of {\textgreater}106-fold. Several similar reactions in this class are described here. The robustness, speed, and sensitivity of the exponential reaction suggest it will be useful in rapidly detecting the presence of small amounts of a specific DNA sequence in a sample, and a range of other applications, including many currently making use of the PCR.},

Since its development, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been the most exploited method, being stablished as the “gold standard” technique for DNA amplification. However, the requirement for different working temperatures leads to the need of a thermocycler machine or complex thermal apparatus, which have been preventing its application in novel integrated devices for single workflow and high throughput analysis. Conversely, isothermal amplification methods have been gaining attention, especially for point-of-care diagnosis and applications. These non-PCR based methods have been developed by mimicking the in vivo amplification mechanisms, while performing the amplification with high sensitivity, selectivity and allowing for high-throughput analysis. These favorable capabilities have pushed forward the implementation and commercialization of several platforms that exploit isothermal amplification methods, mostly against virus, bacteria and other pathogens in water, food, environmental and clinical samples.

We demonstrate successful iSDA amplification and lateral flow detection of 10 copies of a Staphylococcus aureus gene, NO.-inducible L-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1) (Richardson, Libby, and Fang, Science, 2008, 319, 1672–1676), in a clean sample and 50 copies in the presence of high concentrations of genomic DNA and mucins in {\textless}30 minutes. We also present a simple kinetic model of iSDA that incorporates competition between target and primer-dimer amplification. This is the first model that quantitates the effects of primer-dimer products in isothermal amplification reactions. Finally, we demonstrate the multiplexing capability of iSDA by the simultaneous amplification of the target gene and an engineered internal control sequence.

The advent of PCR catalyzed the increasing application of DNA, not just for molecular cloning but also for molecular based diagnostics. Since the introduction of PCR, a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and enzymes involved in DNA/RNA replication has spurred the development of novel methods devoid of temperature cycling. Isothermal amplification methods have since been introduced utilizing different mechanisms, enzymes, and conditions. The ease with which isothermal amplification methods have allowed nucleic acid amplification to be carried out has had a profound impact on the way molecular diagnostics are being designed after the turn of the millennium. With all the advantages isothermal amplification brings, the issues or complications surrounding each method are heterogeneous making it difficult to identify the best approach for an end-user. This review pays special attention to the various isothermal amplification methods by classifying them based on the mechanistic characteristics which include reaction formats, amplification information, promoter, strand break, and refolding mechanisms. We would also compare the efficiencies and usefulness of each method while highlighting the potential applications and detection methods involved.

	abstract = {A self-cleaving elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) tag was used to purify the multisubunit Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) via a simple, nonchromatographic method. To accomplish this, the RNAP α subunit was tagged with a self-cleaving ELP-intein tag and coexpressed with the β, β′, and ω subunits. The assembled RNAP was purified with its associated subunits, and was active and acquired at reasonable yield and purity. To remove residual polynucleotides bound to the purified RNAP, two polymer precipitation methods were investigated: polyethyleneimine (PEI) and polyethylene (PEG) precipitation. The PEG procedure was shown to enhance purity and was compatible with downstream ELP-intein purification. Thus, this simple ELP-based method should be applicable for the nonchromatographic purification of other recombinant, in vivo-assembled multisubunit complexes in a single step. Further, the simplicity and low cost of this method will likely facilitate scale up for large-scale production of additional multimeric protein targets. Finally, this technique may have utility in isolating protein interaction partners that associate with a given target.},

In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay utilizing a new target gene Pcinn100006 identified from genomic sequence data was developed and evaluated for the detection of P. cinnamomi. This Pcinn100006 LAMP assay was found highly specific to P. cinnamomi. All 10 tested isolates of P. cinnamomi yielded positive results, whereas 50 isolates belonging to 16 other Phytophthora species, Globisporangium ultimum, and 14 fungal species lacked detection. This assay was 10 times more sensitive (100 pg in a 25-µl reaction mixture) than a conventional PCR assay (2 ng in a 50-µl reaction mixture) for detecting the genomic DNA of P. cinnamomi. In addition, it detected P. cinnamomi from artificially inoculated leaves of Cedrus deodara. Moreover, detection rates of P. cinnamomi using environmental DNAs extracted from 13 naturally infested rhizosphere samples were 100\% in the Pcinn100006 LAMP assay versus 46\% in the conventional PCR assay. Considering its higher accuracy and shorter time span, this Pcinn100006 LAMP assay is a promising diagnostic tool to replace conventional PCR-based and culture-dependent assays for screening of P. cinnamomi in regions at risk of infection or contamination.},

However, common detection techniques used for LAMP and RT-LAMP have drawbacks, including poor discrimination capability, inability to multiplex targets, high rates of false positives, and (in some cases) the requirement of opening reaction tubes postamplification. Here, we present a simple technique that allows closed-tube, target-specific detection, based on inclusion of a dye-labeled primer that is incorporated into a target-specific amplicon if the target is present. A short, complementary quencher hybridizes to unincorporated primer upon cooling down at the end of the reaction, thereby quenching fluorescence of any unincorporated primer. Our technique, which we term QUASR (for quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters, read “quasar”), does not significantly reduce the amplification efficiency or sensitivity of RT-LAMP. Equipped with a simple LED excitation source and a colored plastic gel filter, the naked eye or a camera can easily discriminate between positive and negative QUASR reactions, which produce a difference in signal of approximately 10:1 without background subtraction. We demonstrate that QUASR detection is compatible with complex sample matrices such as human blood, using a novel LAMP primer set for bacteriophage MS2 (a model RNA virus particle). Furthermore, we demonstrate single-tube duplex detection of West Nile virus (WNV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) RNA.},

As assay protocols and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Here, we report an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and demonstrate the assay on clinical samples using a simple and accessible point-of-care (POC) instrument. We characterized the assay by dipping swabs into synthetic nasal fluid spiked with the virus, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and sampling a volume of the VTM to perform the RT-LAMP assay without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies per μL in the VTM solution within 30 min. We further demonstrate our assay by detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses from 20 clinical samples. Finally, we demonstrate a portable and real-time POC device to detect SARS-CoV-2 from VTM samples using an additively manufactured three-dimensional cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. The POC system was tested using 10 clinical samples, and was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 from these clinical samples by distinguishing positive samples from negative samples after 30 min. The POC tests are in complete agreement with RT-PCR controls. This work demonstrates an alternative pathway for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that does not require conventional laboratory infrastructure, in settings where diagnosis is required at the point of sample collection.},

However, most of the current techniques available employ non-specific signal generation strategies which increase the chance of false positives. Others require a two-step amplification-detection process, in which the tube is opened after amplification, prior to the detection step. This promotes cross-contamination that would lead to unreliable results. Here, we developed a one-pot loop probe-mediated isothermal amplification scheme (oLAMP) coupled with a concurrent target-specific detection readout. We have shown that the said scheme is compatible with crude sample preparation methods and is readily integrated with either fluorescence or electrochemical readouts. The entire process would take 30-40minutes, and we show that our scheme could detect 0.5 or 1 copy/μL of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene using fluorescence or electrochemical readouts, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that the scheme is robust across different biological matrices and other interfering substances. We further show that our method can detect the presence of Salmonella drug resistance gene in crude food samples. Thus, our platform offers a readily scalable and highly specific diagnostic pathway for rapid and decentralized detection of communicable diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide policymakers in resource allocation decisions. It assesses whether the health gains offered by an intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system's budget or ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have an "opportunity cost" in terms of the health foregone because other interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision makers-such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita-do not. OBJECTIVES: To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of countries. METHODS: We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series of explicit assumptions. RESULTS: CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline high-middle/high income) were estimated to be \$3 to \$116 (1\%-51\% GDP per capita), \$44 to \$518 (4\%-51\%), \$422 to \$1967 (11\%-51\%), and \$4485 to \$8018 (32\%-59\%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.},

The resultant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to fever, sore throat, cough, chest and muscle pain, dyspnoea, confusion, anosmia, ageusia and headache. These can progress to life-threatening respiratory insufficiency, also affecting the heart, kidney, liver and nervous systems. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is often confused with that of influenza and seasonal upper respiratory tract viral infections. Due to available treatment strategies and required containments, rapid diagnosis is mandated. This Review brings clarity to the rapidly growing body of available and in-development diagnostic tests, including nanomaterial-based tools.

ELP fusion proteins (referred to as ELPylation) inherit the reversible phase transition property. ELPylation technology recently has been extended to plant cells, and a number of plant-based expression systems have been evaluated for the production of ELPylated proteins. Here, we discuss recent developments in ELP technology and the substantial potential of ELPs for the deployment of transgenic plants as bioreactors to synthesize both biopharmaceuticals and industrial proteins.},

Because their size and sequence are defined, ELPs benefit from exquisite control over their structure and function, qualities that cannot be matched by synthetic polymers.

	abstract = {Reverse-transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has frequently been proposed as an enabling technology for simplified diagnostic tests for RNA viruses. However, common detection techniques used for LAMP and RT-LAMP have drawbacks, including poor discrimination capability, inability to multiplex targets, high rates of false positives, and (in some cases) the requirement of opening reaction tubes postamplification. Here, we present a simple technique that allows closed-tube, target-specific detection, based on inclusion of a dye-labeled primer that is incorporated into a target-specific amplicon if the target is present. A short, complementary quencher hybridizes to unincorporated primer upon cooling down at the end of the reaction, thereby quenching fluorescence of any unincorporated primer. Our technique, which we term QUASR (for quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters, read “quasar”), does not significantly reduce the amplification efficiency or sensitivity of RT-LAMP. Equipped with a simple LED excitation source and a colored plastic gel filter, the naked eye or a camera can easily discriminate between positive and negative QUASR reactions, which produce a difference in signal of approximately 10:1 without background subtraction. We demonstrate that QUASR detection is compatible with complex sample matrices such as human blood, using a novel LAMP primer set for bacteriophage MS2 (a model RNA virus particle). Furthermore, we demonstrate single-tube duplex detection of West Nile virus (WNV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) RNA.},

In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay utilizing a new target gene Pcinn100006 identified from genomic sequence data was developed and evaluated for the detection of P. cinnamomi. This Pcinn100006 LAMP assay was found highly specific to P. cinnamomi. All 10 tested isolates of P. cinnamomi yielded positive results, whereas 50 isolates belonging to 16 other Phytophthora species, Globisporangium ultimum, and 14 fungal species lacked detection. This assay was 10 times more sensitive (100 pg in a 25-µl reaction mixture) than a conventional PCR assay (2 ng in a 50-µl reaction mixture) for detecting the genomic DNA of P. cinnamomi. In addition, it detected P. cinnamomi from artificially inoculated leaves of Cedrus deodara. Moreover, detection rates of P. cinnamomi using environmental DNAs extracted from 13 naturally infested rhizosphere samples were 100\% in the Pcinn100006 LAMP assay versus 46\% in the conventional PCR assay. Considering its higher accuracy and shorter time span, this Pcinn100006 LAMP assay is a promising diagnostic tool to replace conventional PCR-based and culture-dependent assays for screening of P. cinnamomi in regions at risk of infection or contamination.},

However, the effectiveness of both approaches diminish over time, and neither of them are profitable after 2009.

To address this question we studied Paneth cells, a key small intestinal epithelial lineage. We found that Paneth cells directly sense enteric bacteria through cell-autonomous MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, triggering expression of multiple antimicrobial factors. Paneth cells were essential for controlling intestinal barrier penetration by commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, Paneth cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling limited bacterial penetration of host tissues, revealing a role for epithelial MyD88 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Our findings establish that gut epithelia actively sense enteric bacteria and play an essential role in maintaining host-microbial homeostasis at the mucosal interface.},

Specifically, we discuss how various CRISPR-Cas systems can be engineered and delivered using phages or phagemids as vectors. These principles establish CRISPR-Cas systems as potent and programmable antimicrobials, and open new avenues for the development of CRISPR-based tools for selective removal of bacterial pathogens and precise microbiome composition alteration.},
